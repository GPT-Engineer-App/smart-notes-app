AI-Powered Notes App: Project Briefing
Core Concept
We're building a revolutionary notes application that leverages artificial intelligence to simplify the note-taking and organization process for users. The key idea is to create a system where users can input their thoughts freely, while the AI handles the complex tasks of categorization, organization, and retrieval.
Primary Objectives

Effortless Input: Provide users with a clean, minimal interface for quick and easy note entry.
Intelligent Organization: Utilize AI to automatically categorize and organize notes without user intervention.
Smart Retrieval: Implement a natural language query system that allows users to find information in their notes easily.
Adaptive System: Create an AI model that learns from user behavior and continuously improves its organization and retrieval capabilities.
Seamless Experience: Ensure a consistent and intuitive experience across both web and mobile platforms.

Key Features (MVP)

Minimalist user interface with a focus on the note input area
AI-powered automatic note categorization
Dynamic reorganization of notes based on content and patterns
Natural language querying for note retrieval
Basic mobile app for note capture and querying

Development Approach
The development should focus on creating a robust foundation that allows for easy integration of AI capabilities. Start with building the core note-taking functionality and gradually incorporate AI features, beginning with basic categorization and expanding to more advanced features as the system evolves.
Remember, the ultimate goal is to create a notes app where the user doesn't have to worry about organization - they simply input their thoughts, and the AI takes care of the rest. - Be inspired by the aesthetics of the attached app, but not the specifics of the layout and keep in mind it's in dark mode you should use black font and #F4F4F4 for the background.
